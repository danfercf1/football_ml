# Football Match Analysis and Betting Rules System Summary

## Overview

This project implements a football match analysis and betting recommendation system with a specialized implementation of the "Under X In-Play" betting strategy. The system analyzes live football matches and generates betting recommendations based on configurable rules.

## Completed Tasks

1. Fixed the ModuleNotFoundError in `analyze_match.py` script by adding the project root directory to the Python path.
2. Created a comprehensive betting rules system in `src/betting_rules.py` with:
   - Class-based rules implementation with inheritance (BettingRule, GoalsRule, StakeRule, TimeRule, CompositeRule)
   - Dictionary-based fallback for compatibility
   - Rule evaluation functions to test if a match meets criteria
3. Created a JSON export function that converts betting rules to a standardized format
4. Created a JavaScript example file `betting_rules_example.js` that matches the requested structure
5. Fixed the error in `under_x_inplay.py` script when applying betting rules (`'GoalsRule' object has no attribute 'get'`)
6. Added testing scripts to verify the betting rules functionality

## Pending Tasks

1. RabbitMQ connection authentication issues (optional, not part of the core task)
2. MongoDB authentication issues (optional, not part of the core task)

## Key Files Modified/Created

- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/src/betting_rules.py`: Fixed to handle both class-based and dictionary-based rules
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/scripts/analyze_match.py`: Fixed Python path issue
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/scripts/analyze_match.py`: Fixed Python path issue
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/scripts/under_x_inplay.py`: Fixed to use dictionary-based rules
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/scripts/fixed_under_x_inplay.py`: Fixed standalone implementation
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/betting_rules_example.js`: JavaScript example of betting rules
- `/home/daniel/Projects/football_ml/test_perfect_match.py`: Testing script for a perfect match

## How to Use the System

1. For simple match analysis, use `analyze_match.py`:

   ```bash
   python scripts/analyze_match.py path/to/match/data.json
   ```

2. For running the Under X In-Play strategy, use one of:

   ```bash
   python scripts/under_x_inplay.py  # Original with fixes
   python scripts/fixed_under_x_inplay.py  # Fully fixed version
   ```

3. To test the betting rules with a perfect match:

   ```bash
   python test_perfect_match.py
   ```

## Betting Rules Format

The betting rules system supports both class-based rules and dictionary-based rules. For compatibility, dictionary-based rules are recommended:

```python
[
    {
        "rule_type": "goals",
        "active": True,
        "odds": {
            "min": 1.01,
            "max": 1.05
        },
        "min_goals": 1,
        "max_goals": 3,
        "min_goal_line_buffer": 2.5
    },
    {
        "rule_type": "stake",
        "active": True,
        "stake": 0.50,
        "stake_strategy": "fixed"
    },
    {
        "rule_type": "time",
        "active": True,
        "min_minute": 52,
        "max_minute": 61
    }
]
```

## Notes

- The RabbitMQ connection issue is not critical for the core functionality
- The MongoDB connection string has been updated but authentication issues persist
- The Under X In-Play strategy works correctly with the fixed implementation
